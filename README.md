# Stardew Valley Villager Helper
Provides access to a handful of Stardew Valley Villager information.

This very basic WPF (C#, XAML) web scrapping application pulls in Villager data from the Stardew Valley wiki.

The tool was created as a helpful utility for players while playing the game. Rather than needing to navigate to the wiki to find out Villager information, it's easily provided within this app.

## Details
The app stores the avatar images locally, the first time it is loaded and ran. Subsequent runs make use of the already existing data.

Functionality is provided within the app to reload this data at any time.

## Licenses
The app makes use of some Fonts. I have provided all the licenses which were available with the fonts themselves.

I do not make money on this application, and share it openly with others. Should it infringe on any IP, I'm happy to remove it.

## Screenshot

Below this is character information, inclusive of birthday, whether they are available for marriage, gender, where they live, their address, their family members as a list, and their loved gifts, also as a list. At the very bottom is the loading bar. At the top right is a reload button.](images/StardewValley_VillagerHelper.png)
